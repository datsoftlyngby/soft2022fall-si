Richardson Maturity Model Level-2: HTTP Verbs
    - share operations across resources
    - add model attributes validation and exception handling

Request Examples
CREATE : POST /api/users
READ   : GET /api/users/42
UPDATE : PUT /api/users/42
DELETE : DEL /api/users/42
SEARCH : GET /api/users?sort=name

Better than the Level 1, but not as good as Level 3!
